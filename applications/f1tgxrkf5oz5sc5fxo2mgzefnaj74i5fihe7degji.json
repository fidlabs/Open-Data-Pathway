    "Brief history of your project and organization": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global mapping project that aims to create a free, editable map. It is contributed by volunteers, and users can collect and update geographic information through GPS, aerial imagery, and other sources. Here are some important information about OpenStreetMap:\n\nFeatures\nOpenness: OSM data is completely open and can be used, modified, and shared by anyone. This makes it a very flexible tool for a variety of applications.\nCommunity-driven: OSM relies on contributions from volunteers around the world. These contributors can be anyone, from professional geographers to ordinary users.\nRich data: OSM contains a variety of geographic information such as roads, buildings, rivers, mountains, public transportation routes, etc., covering urban and rural areas.\nMultiple uses: Developers can use OSM data to build map applications, perform geographic analysis, or use it for navigation and positioning services.\nMultiple formats: Data can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as XML, PBF files, etc., to facilitate different usage scenarios.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use the command line tools to download, we have the AWS CLI tools installed, download directly from AWS in the EU Central 1 and US West 2 regions. This is faster than downloading normally.\nCommand line:\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://osm-planet-eu-central-1/\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://osm-planet-us-west-2/\n",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[ yes] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1-2 year",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Europe, South America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03519438  HK\nf03312989   HK\nf02826126  HK\nf02827880  HK\nf02827288  ShangHai\nf02827045   ShangHai\nf09693  SiChuan\nf03358608 HK\nf03233304 United States\nf02924003 United States",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
