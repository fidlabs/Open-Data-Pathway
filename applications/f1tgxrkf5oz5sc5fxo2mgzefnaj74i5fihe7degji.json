    "Brief history of your project and organization": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global mapping project that aims to create a free, editable map. It is contributed by volunteers, and users can collect and update geographic information through GPS, aerial imagery, and other sources. Here are some important information about OpenStreetMap:\n\nFeatures\nOpenness: OSM data is completely open and can be used, modified, and shared by anyone. This makes it a very flexible tool for a variety of applications.\nCommunity-driven: OSM relies on contributions from volunteers around the world. These contributors can be anyone, from professional geographers to ordinary users.\nRich data: OSM contains a variety of geographic information such as roads, buildings, rivers, mountains, public transportation routes, etc., covering urban and rural areas.\nMultiple uses: Developers can use OSM data to build map applications, perform geographic analysis, or use it for navigation and positioning services.\nMultiple formats: Data can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as XML, PBF files, etc., to facilitate different usage scenarios.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "``\nWe use the command line tools to download, we have the AWS CLI tools installed, download directly from AWS in the EU Central 1 and US West 2 regions. This is faster than downloading normally.\nCommand line:\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://osm-planet-eu-central-1/\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://osm-planet-us-west-2/",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": ""
