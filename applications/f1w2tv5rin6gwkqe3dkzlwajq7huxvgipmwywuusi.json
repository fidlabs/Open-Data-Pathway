    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "For private content (such as customer data), we will use a method similar to the one found at https://github.com/VshareCloud-Project/Filecoin-Storage-Tool/ , where we encrypt and package the data using openssl and zstd before splitting it into volumes. For open data sets, we will directly package and split them into volumes (although most compression algorithms have a general effect on AI model weights and data sets). After the data set is split, we will use Boost for CommP calculations, converting it into .car files. After initiating an offline deal, we will use our IPFS-based distribution network for transmission, and the data will be delivered to the Storage Provider (SP) to download from the IPFS network and import into the nodes Boostd, further importing the data into sectors and completing the deal.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://gateway.ipns.tech/ipfs/QmfC5KT8UP9Avc8MHxVoT9j7CFTZDZ4AqctY2ouNhztke6\r\nhttps://gateway.ipns.tech/ipfs/QmZ51Vb9aCgUZPXva71be9hD8FuWnd8Ks4qg7AmGtdFPEK\r\nhttps://gateway.ipns.tech/ipfs/QmeMa2yRpaxZzX8qZ7knqgsY22wz7o7MSkEaRA5PcJ2F13",
