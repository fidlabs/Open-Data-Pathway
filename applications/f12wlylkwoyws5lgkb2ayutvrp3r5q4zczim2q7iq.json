    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Share a brief history of your project and organization: sdcloud is a distributed storage system developed based on blockchain and distributed storage technology. It perfectly solves core issues such as \"protecting data privacy\" and \"reducing storage costs\", and provides a reliable data storage solution for privacy data security and ownership issues in the big data era.The personal end-to-end login method is more convenient, providing private storage space and public data sharing platform for personal accounts. Work files, life records, videos, audios, photos and other documents can be stored in the cloud anytime and anywhere, and the download speed is increased by more than 60%. With data slicing storage, private key support and content addressing technology, there is no need to worry about the hidden danger of private files being peeped.",
