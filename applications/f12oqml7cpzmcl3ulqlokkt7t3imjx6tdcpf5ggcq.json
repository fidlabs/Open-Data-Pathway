    "Brief history of your project and organization": "An overview of MODIS land standard products. Its main goal is to achieve comprehensive observations of solar radiation, atmosphere, ocean and land from a single series polar orbit space platform, obtain information about the ocean, land, cryosphere and solar dynamic system, conduct land use and land cover research, climate seasonal and interannual changes, natural disaster monitoring and analysis research, long-term climate variability changes and atmospheric ozone changes, and achieve the overall (strategic) goal of long-term observation and research on atmospheric and earth environmental changes. As a filecoin data preparer, we have a mature team to carry out data storage. The initial plan is to cooperate with ten storage providers to complete this data storage.",
