    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Projec:OpenDataLab, established by the Shanghai AI Lab's large model database team, is the chosen platform for Chinese Large Model Corpus Data Alliance's open data services. It offers comprehensive AI data support to developers, mitigating data processing risks and fostering AI research and applications\r\nAbout me: I have joined the Filecoin ecosystem since 2019, and have been active in the community since the second half of 2020, and have contributed to filecoin Greater China by providing resource information reports, resource docking, etc.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
