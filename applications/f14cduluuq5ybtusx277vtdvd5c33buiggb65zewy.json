    "Brief history of your project and organization": "We are building a long-term archive of historical market data from futures exchanges, including tick-by-tick price data, order book snapshots, trade volume, and settlement information.\nThe dataset serves as a valuable resource for academic research, algorithmic trading development, and financial analytics. It helps researchers and engineers study market dynamics, price formation, volatility behavior, and test quantitative strategies in reproducible ways.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The historical market data from exchanges, including tick-by-tick price data, and other time level like 1 minutes, 5 minutes... K line data.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The history data is already there, and we are keeping working on the new data. We make the tools to collect and processing the data ourselves.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://pan.baidu.com/s/19ReXlX03nEEDcmJnyIyuXA?pwd=496V\n\n20210105,a2109,DCE,
